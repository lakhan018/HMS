Objective:
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based application designed to manage the daily operations of a hospital. The system uses Python with the Django framework for backend development, SQL for database management, and basic frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interfaces.

Tech Stack:

Database: SQL (SQLite or MySQL)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for basic user interaction)
Key Features:
User Authentication:

Register and login functionality for hospital staff (doctors, nurses, admin, etc.).
Different roles with varying permissions (admin, staff, patient).
Patient Management:

Add, update, and delete patient records.
View patient history, medical reports, and prescriptions.
Assign doctors to patients for specific treatments.
Appointment Scheduling:

Allow patients to book appointments with doctors.
Track and manage appointment details, including status (pending, confirmed, completed).
Billing and Payment:

Doctors: Store doctor details (specialization, availability, etc.).
Appointments: Track patient appointments (date, time, doctor assigned, status).
Bills/Payments: Store billing information for each patient (charge details, payment status).
Django Implementation:
Models: Define models for patients, doctors, appointments, and payments.
Views: Handle the logic for adding/editing/deleting data, managing appointments, and generating reports.
URLs: Map URLs to views for easy navigation.
Forms: Create forms for patient registration, appointment booking, and billing.
Admin Panel: Use Django's built-in admin panel for managing hospital data.
Frontend:
HTML: Structure the web pages for patient registration, appointment booking, and dashboards.
CSS: Style the web pages to create a clean and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Add interactivity for forms, such as validation or dynamic updates.
Basic Workflow:
Admin logs in: Admin manages hospital staff, assigns doctors to patients, and tracks overall hospital activities.
Patient registration: Patients register, book appointments, and view their medical records.
Doctorâ€™s interaction: Doctors log in to view and manage their appointments, patient history, and medical reports.
Conclusion:
The Hospital Management System streamlines hospital operations by providing an easy-to-use platform for managing patient records, appointments, billing, and staff. Using Python, Django, SQL, and basic frontend technologies, the system simplifies hospital management tasks and enhances efficiency.
